    "1. What country has the most suicides, or the highest average rate of suicide from year to year?\n",

    "4. Do the events of a given year have an impact on global or regionally focused suicides?  If so, which years and what kinds of events?\n",

    "To gather information about each year from 1985 - 2016, we webscrape the Wikipedia pages for each year, saving each of the notable events into a dataframe which we can further mine for positive/negative sentiment which may give insight into why some years show an global/regional/isolated increase in suicide rates from year to year.\n",
