    "1. What country has the most suicides, or the highest average rate of suicide from year to year?\n",
    "2. Is there a relationship between generation or age demographic and propensity for suicide?\n",
    "3. Is there relationship between a country's gdp and rate of suicide?\n",
    "4. Do the events of a given year have an impact on global or regionally focused suicides?  If so, which years and what kinds of events?\n",
    "  - Create our own criteria based on findings, if we can, that contribute to the negation of high suicide rates (e.g. high gdp? positive words in the text analysis as well). As the motivation of the Q."

    "Our [primary data set](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) taken from Kaggle has sufficient information to examine the first 3 hypotheses, but in order to qualify/quantify information about the events from each year which may provide insights into the cause of change in this data from year to year, country to country, etc., we need to collect more data in the hopes of modelling a sentiment value that we can ascribe to each of the years contained within our first data set.\n",

    "To gather information about each year from 1985 - 2016, we webscrape the Wikipedia pages for each year, saving each of the notable events (see the attached image) into a dataframe which we can further mine for positive/negative sentiment which may give insight into why some years show a global/regional/isolated increase or decrease in suicide rates from year to year or country to country.\n",

    "We observe that each of the relevant bullet points under the `Events` heading on the webpage is stored in a `<ul>` element that directly follows the `<h3>` tag containing a `<span>` describing the month of the year.  With this in mind, our approach is to find the `<span>` tags corresponding to each month, navigate to the next `<ul>` immediately proceeding that `<span>` and gather the text fields from each constituent `<li>` tag within.

For the sake of our research questions, want to ensure to distinguish between the two and reserve the right to forego use of the topical score heavily in further analysis because of this overlap.
